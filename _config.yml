  The names Kent, I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast, don't really care what I'm learning as long as I'm learning something.
  Currently busy with Malware Analysis and Malware Development, but hey
  these are my notes so feel free to go through it if you want :P. 
  (PS, Did I write or record information that's wrong or invalid? Shoot me an email about
  an email about the error, and I'll look into it, or you could just email me calling me a d**k head too, kinda rude, but I don't care :D.)
