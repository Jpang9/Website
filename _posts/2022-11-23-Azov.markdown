Azov, A ransomware designed to encrypt data (obviously), except the catch isn't to demand a ransom,
it's to accuse well known cyber-security researchers.

### Executive Summary
Azov is a 64bit Windows Ransomware.

It acts as a dropper, which drops a malicious binary with the name "rdpclient.exe" onto C:\ along with other 
components into C:\$Recycle.bin, it also abuses HKLM/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run for persistence.

This Ransomware isn't designed to extort cash or cryptocurrency, but is designed to frame well-known security researchers.
<br>
<br>

### High Level Executive Summary
Upon execution of the dropper, the binary will enumerate contents within C:\$Recycle.Bin, than proceed to delete all files within the $Recycle.Bin share.

Once the files has been removed, it will dump the components used by the ransomware into the $Recycle.bin share, and 
once the files has been dumped, and for its final instruction, it will create the runonce persistence mechanism for the dropped binary.

Upon rebooting, the dropped binary "C:\ProgramData\rdpclient.exe", will execute through the runonce registry instruction.

Rdpclient.exe acts as the main encryption binary, it also has the ability to perform a self check on its binary name, throwing a rdp error if the binary name
has been modified.

Upon execution, the malware will begin querying data and encrypting it with the azov extension, eventually causing all non-system components to be encrypted.

![obfuscation](/images/Azov/rdppersistrunbyExplorer.png)
Once the device has been restarted, the runonce will execute the malicious "rdpclient.exe". <br>
Used for obfuscation as "Explorer.exe" is a normal windows binary and "rdpclient.exe" is masquerading as a non-malicious binary.

![querysystemfiles](/images/Azov/queryingandopeningfiles.png)
![encryptdata](/images/Azov/renamingFileswithazov.png)
The malware will begin querying system information and encrypting said information.
<br>
<br>

![renamingRDP](/images/Azov/modifyingname.png)
If you rename "rdpclient.exe", since the malware does a self-check on its binary name, if the name has been modified, it will show a rdp error.
