Azov, A ransomware designed to encrypt data (obviously), except the catch isn't to demand a ransom,
it's to accuse well known cyber-security researchers.

### Executive Summary
Azov is a Windows based Ransomware designed with persistence through RunOnce registry abuse.

It also has the ability to act as a dropper; dropping a malicious binary with the name "rdpclient.exe" onto C:\ along with other 
components into C:\$Recycle.bin

This Ransomware isn't designed to extort cash or cryptocurrency, but is designed to frame well-known security researchers.

<br>

### High Level Executive Summary
Upon execution of the dropper, the binary will enumerate contents within C:\$Recycle.Bin, than proceed to delete all files within the $Recycle.Bin share.

Once the files has been removed, it will dump the components used by the ransomware into the $Recycle.bin share, and once the files has been dumped, it will create a startup persistence
with Explorer.EXE (I'm unsure how this is performed), and pretty much end the dropper program there.

Upon rebooting, the dropped binary "C:\ProgramData\rdpclient.exe", will execute through the startup execution.

Neat thing about "rdpclient.exe" is that it functions as the main binary that encrypts file contents, and it's also used to set up the runonce registry persistence for itself.
This binary will also perform a name check on itself, it will check if the filename has been modified, and if it has been modified; it will throw a rdp help prompt.

Upon execution of the dropped binary, the malware will carry out persistence, and the generic ransomware procedure, encrypting anything that isn't necessary and leaving a note for the victim to read,
which contains information regarding these security researchers.
