<!-- excerpt_start -->
Amadey, designed as a lightweight trojan; is designed to initially infect and persist on an infected computer until 
the threat actor decides to deploy a malicious payload for the malware to execute. <br>
Malicious payloads such as post-exploit tools, ransomware or stealers.

### Executive Summary
Amadey is a Trojan-type malware built for the Windows operating system, designed to persist on the infected system until the threat actor decides to load a malicious payload 
onto the system and have it executed within the system via the trojan. <br>
The malware uses scheduled tasks for persistence, the malware also uses a binary location check to ensure the malware is executed within the right location.
<br>
<br>

### High Level Executive Summary
Upon execution, the malware will begin a "self-check" function, this function will check the binaries current location and if it isn't located at %username%\local\Temp, it will 
then create a directory with the following regex "ecac[0-9]{5}", and will copy itself into this directory with the name "gntuud.exe"; once the binary has been copied to the correct
location, it will then execute the new binary and end the current one.<br>

Upon execution of the new binary; as it is pretty much just the same binary as the original but moved, it will perform the check and once the check has passed with the 
correct parameters, it will first set up persistence with scheduled task. <br>

Then it will call back to the C2 Listening post with a unique ID and basic information about the infected device, effectively "registering" the infected device to the 
C2 Botnet; the malware will use this unique ID to contact the C2 for further instructions/payloads, and while waiting for further instructions, the malware will passively query
and send system information back to the listening post.

This sample is not packed as shown through the differences in the raw and virtual size, only notable information is the odd volume names

![Check](/images/Amadey/LocationCheck.png)
Looks to be some sort of system check due to its "Boolean" result expectancy.

![sha256Sum](/images/Amadey/samebinary.png)
The malware performs a location check, and if it doesn't match the criteria it will create a directory in the user AppData/Temp directory, which is then used to
create a copy of the original binary into that location and have it executed from the new location.

<br>

![Persistance](/images/Amadey/secondaryPersistcall.png)
![scheduledTask](/images/Amadey/schtaskPOC.png)
The malware uses scheduled task to persist on shutdown/startup
<br>

Signs that this malware uses task scheduler to persist.

![DataSent](/images/Amadey/deviceIDandCallback.png)
![initialCallBack](/images/Amadey/initialcallbackpoc.png)
The initial callback to the C2 server provides the listening post information regarding the current device along with its unique ID. <br>
This request format is used periodically to retrieve and execute the next instruction if any further instructions exist.
<br>
<br>

![TCPcallbacks](/images/Amadey/wiresharkinfo.png)
![DataStream](/images/Amadey/encryptedData.png)
I would assume system information is sent back to the C2 like this, I'm unable to fully confirm as the data is encrypted.<br>
(The TCP call fails as it cannot call back to the C2 Server due to how my environment is configured.)
