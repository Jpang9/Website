### Executive Summary
AsyncRat is a windows based trojan with the intent of controlling and monitoring a computer remotely through an encrypted connection; this malware is written in C#
and has persistence along with sandbox checks during its execution process.
<br>
<br>

### Executive Summary
Upon execution, the binary will unpack its settings and configs with a decrypt call using a CBC Decryption algorithm along with a basic Base64 decipher step.
<br>

Once the malware configuration has been "unpacked", the malware will perform multiple "if" instructions, these instructions contains the Anti-Analysis checks, the persistence
installation mechanism, and if any of these checks have failed, it will tell the binary to finish up and stop running.
<br>

If the checks have passed without any errors, it will than call back to the C2 server for further instructions. <br>
The malware also has the ability to passively collect information regarding cryptowallets addresses while running.
