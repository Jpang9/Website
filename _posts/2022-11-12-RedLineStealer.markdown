RedLine Stealer; a stealer type malware distributed through macro-laced office documents or marketed as "Cracked" software,
designed to steal credentials along with
the function to deploy a second stage malware. This malware is obtainable for 150-200$ on hacker forums, and is intended as malware
as a service.

### Executive Summary
RedLine Stealer is a Stealer type malware, designed to enumerate and exfiltrate system information and files.<br>

Exfiltrated information is sent through a TCP protocol back to the Command & Control address, and once exfiltrated, the malware can deploy a second stage
malware such as a trojan or ransomware. <br>

RedLine stealer doesn't have a persistence mechanism and is commonly deployed through macro-laced documents or disguised as "Cracked" software.

### High Level Executive Summary
Upon Execution, The malware will start multiple threads; these threads are used to decrypt the information block which contains
the instructions for redline stealer to execute, these strings are decrypted than arranged into a specific order which than
forms the decrypted instructions for red line stealer.

The decrypted instruction is than stored as a "Variable" within the binary; After the decryption process is completed, it will
perform Process injection to have this code segment execute.

The malware will start and suspend "AppLaunch.exe" (A Legitimate binary from Microsoft's .Net Framework); after AppLaunch.exe has been started,
the malware will then query and write the decoded segment into AppLaunch's memory. 

After the segment has been written into the binary,
the malware will then call the "FlushInstructionCache" Api to remove any traces of process injection instruction.

After the process injection has been carried out, the injected process will now be removed from the suspended state and start querying 
sensitive and system information.

Information retrieved from the enumerating process is exfiltrated via a TCP request and may install a second stage malware, 
assuming that setting has been configured.

### Static Analysis
![DecryptionAPICall](/images/RedLineStealer/DecryptionAPI.png)
Api Calls used by the decryption process, alot of apis related to kernal32.dll.
<br>
<br>

![Packed?](/images/RedLineStealer/VirtualVsRaw.png)
Difference between virtual and raw byte doesn't seem too much, suspect binary is not packed.
<br>
<br>

![XorCall](/images/RedLineStealer/DecryptionStatic.png)
Malcat detected a XOR loop in this part of the binary, used for data decryption or encryption.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Dynamic Analysis
![ChildProcess](/images/RedLineStealer/ChildProcess.png)
The Malware spawns a child process of a legitimate binary

![AppLaunchTCP](/images/RedLineStealer/AppLaunchTcpTOC2.png)
![TCPCALLPROCMON](/images/RedLineStealer/ContinousCallsTCP.png)
The malware abuses "AppLaunch.exe" to call back to it's C2.

##### Attempted to catch TCP callback with another sample
![SecondarySample](/images/RedLineStealer/SecondSample.png)
![CaughtTCP](/images/RedLineStealer/TCPCATCH.png)
Attempted to catch the TCP request with another sample as it wasn't a process injection type attack. <br>
Response is IP of malicious C2 address.
<br>
<br>


![ThreadCreation](/images/RedLineStealer/DecryptionThreadCalls.png)
Performs Multithreading to quickly decrypt the encrypted data.
<br>
<br>

![Threaded Decryption Instruction](/images/RedLineStealer/DecryptionInstructionThreaded.png)<br>
Red - Convert string to UTF-16 <br>
Blue - The Decryption Instruction <br>
Pink - Add Decrypted string on top of previous string <br>

![Instruction to start Child Binary](/images/RedLineStealer/StartAppLaunchSuspended.png)
This call instruction is used to start the "AppLauncher.exe" binary in a suspended state.
<br>
<br>

![Process Injection](/images/RedLineStealer/ProcessInjection.png)
The decoded block is than injected into "AppLauncher.exe".
<br>

![Before Process Injection](/images/RedLineStealer/BeforeInjection.png)
Before Process Injection
<br>
<br>

![After Process Injection](/images/RedLineStealer/PostInjection.png)
After Process Injection, once the process injection has occurred, the "AppLauncher.exe" will exit from a suspended
state and execute the malware code
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Something Interesting I learnt
If you can find what binary the malware is injecting into; you can actually use process-hacker to dump the strings of the 
memory that is sitting in the infected binary.

<br>
<br>

![SystemEnumeration](/images/RedLineStealer/SysEnv.png)
By dumping the strings, you can now see what the malware is trying to do, such as, enumerating your system configs
<br>
<br>

![ContentChecking](/images/RedLineStealer/TypesofDatatoSteal.png)
Or even what the malware is looking for and clues to how it is retrieving it from your system.

It also has details on what crypto-wallet it is looking for.
